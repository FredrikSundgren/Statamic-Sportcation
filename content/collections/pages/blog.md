Use this static Page to test the Theme's handling of the Blog Posts Index page. If the site is set to display a static Page on the Front Page, and this Page is set to display the Blog Posts Index, then this text should not appear. The title might, so make sure the theme is not supplying a hard-coded title for the Blog Post Index.
